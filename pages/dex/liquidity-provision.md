## How to Provide Liquidity

1. **Select a Pool**: Choose a trading pair you're interested in.
2. **Deposit Tokens**: Add an equal value of both tokens in the pair to the pool.
3. **Receive LP Tokens**: In return, you'll get liquidity provider tokens representing your share.

## Innovative LP Features

**Time-based liquidity provider rewards through a unique design that rewards liquidity providers of earliest in period, highest in amount and longest in duration of characteristic pool capital.**

## Reward Formula

**Stake Weight ∝ Time × Principal**

Your rewards grow exponentially based on both the duration you provide liquidity and the amount of capital committed. This innovative mechanism ensures that dedicated liquidity providers are rewarded proportionally to their contribution to pool stability.

## Incentives & Rewards

- **Multiple Revenue Streams**: Earn from LP fees plus potential $MAGE token and NFT staking rewards
- **Duration Multipliers**: The longer you provide liquidity, the higher your reward percentage
- **Capital Efficiency**: Larger positions combined with time commitment maximize returns
- **Ecosystem Participation**: Access to exclusive opportunities within the Mage Labs ecosystem

## Advanced Features

* **Optimized Capital Efficiency**: Lamport dynamics ensure maximum utilization of provided liquidity
* **Time-Based Fee Distribution**: Revolutionary mechanism that compounds rewards for sustained participation
* **Staking Integration**: Combine LP rewards with $MAGE token and NFT staking for maximum returns

NOTE: Providing liquidity involves risks including impermanent loss. Always do your own research and understand the risks before participating.
