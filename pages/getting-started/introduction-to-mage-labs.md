# Introduction to Mage Labs

Mage Labs tackles the problem of capital efficiency in DeFi trading through optimized Lamport dynamics and a built-in reward system. It empowers new trading dynamics by implementing a distinct flat fee structure.

* Unique design that rewards liquidity providers through novel fee distribution mechanisms focused on early participation, higher amounts, and longer duration staking.

* Executing trades through a constant fee per swap that gives better trade performance for larger trades and attracts higher volume.

* Advanced DEX technology that maximizes rewards for ecosystem participants through the innovative reward claim model.

This combination enables new dynamics in the Solana DeFi market which Mage Labs is uniquely positioned to facilitate due to the nature of the platform and the community supporting it.
